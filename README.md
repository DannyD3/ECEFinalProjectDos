# ECEFinalProjectDos
Final project for ECE 175. This script allows the user to play a text-based simplified version of DOS.

Current Status:
1. main, card.c, and card.h files are created
2. card array named "deck" is created successfully

To-Do:
1. Figure out what the card.action string is for
2. Make a function to compare the sum and colors of matched cards with a centerline card (Function overloading does not work in C, but it does in C++)
3. Create a game loop function
4. Find some way to assign card locations (card.action???)
