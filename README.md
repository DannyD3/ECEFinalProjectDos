# ECEFinalProjectDos
Final project for ECE 175. This script allows the user to play a text-based simplified version of DOS.

Current Status:
1. main, card.c, and card.h files are created
2. card array named "deck" is created successfully
3. deck is shuffled successfully
4. seven cards are dealt to players and two are placed on the centerline
5. The only feature that still needs to be added to the setup phase of the script is an option to use a preloaded deck of cards. This will require a translation of the cards into the system that our script uses

To-Do:
1. Create a function to deal with matching cards to the centerline cards
2. Create a turn counter int and a turn function to carry out the main process of the game
3. Create conditionals/checks that determine if game is over
4. Create a scoring function
